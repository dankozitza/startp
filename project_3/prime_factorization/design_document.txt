Introduction:

   This program, prime_factorization, takes one command line argument (a 
positive integer) and outputs a list of the prime factors of that integer.

Functions:

   The function, factor, does most of the work for this program. It recursively 
computes the prime factors of an integer n.

The Main Program:

   The main program parses the command line argument then passes it to the 
factor function.
