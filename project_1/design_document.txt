Introduction:

   are_anagrams is a program that takes two user input strings and determines if
they are anagrams. After determining whether or not they are it reports this
result to the user.

Data Structures:

   The program uses two data structures. These are both maps who's keys are char
and who's values are int. The keys a-z are meant to be set and their int values
determine the number of times that character was used in the string given by
the user.

Functions:

   The program uses four functions. The first, 'is_lc_letter', determines
whether the char it is given is a lowercase letter a-z. The second,
'define_set', takes a map<char, int> pointer and sets the keys a-z to 0. The
third, 'get_set', reads from an istream and increments the appropriate key
values in the map it is given. The fourth, 'sets_equal', takes two
map<char, int>s and checks that the keys a-z are equal.

Main:

   The main program creates the two data structures used by 'define_set',
'get_set', and 'sets_equal'. Then it calls those functions while outputing
helpful information about what's going on.
