   This program, backspace, was surprisingly easy to write. The doubly linked 
list works great for this use case. All methods needed were simple and 
straightforward. The only case i neglected to account for originally was within 
the remove_last function when last is equal to first. I would prefer to build 
this using the command line arguments as input but the assignment suggested 
using the cin.get function. The empty function is not used in my program. Due 
to how small it is i didn't think it was necessary to include a test for it.
