   This program, infixcalc, takes one argument from the command line (a file 
name) and reads the file evaluating each line as if it were an infix arithmetic 
expression. Ex: the expression '7 + 5' would equal '12'.

The source for this program can be found on csci2 in the directory:

   /export/home/cs301/cs301145/projects/csci301_7/src

From within that directory enter the folowing commands:

Compile:

   g++ -c Infxcalc.cpp -c L_Stack.cpp -c infixcalc.cpp

Link:

   g++ Infxcalc.o L_Stack.o infixcalc.o -o infixcalc

Execute:

   ./infixcalc FILE
