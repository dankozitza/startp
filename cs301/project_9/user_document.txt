This program, sort_test, is used to compare different sorting algorithms. To 
run the test these parameters must be entered: The number of values to be 
generated and sorted, and a random integer to be used for the seed. They can
either be entered on the command line arguments with the -n and -s options
or they can be entered from within the program. Use the -h option to get
a list of available options.

The source for this program can be found on csci2 in the directory:

/export/home/cs301/cs301145/projects/csci301_9/src

From within that directory enter the following commands:

Compile:

   g++ -c sort_test.cpp

Link:

   g++ sort_test.o -o sort_test

Execute:

   ./sort_test
