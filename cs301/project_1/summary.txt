In this project i decided to use maps with char keys and int values. I know
there are other ways i could have gone about this but for me this was the
most straightforward way. It was difficult for me to explain in words how it
works.

In both cases where i use assert it's checking that the number of characters
entered by the user is more than zero and less than 61. Instead of having
the program explode i would rather have it explain why the input was invalid
and prompt for input again. This means i would need the get_set function to
return a bool to indicate whether it worked or not.
