Introduction:

   This program, backspace, takes a string of characters and returns the result 
if the '#' character were a backspace. For example the input 'woo#rd' would 
produce the output 'word'. This can be useful for implementing a program that 
requires text entry.

Data Structures:

   The program uses a doubly linked list to store the characters entered by the 
user. Each node of the list has a character, a pointer to the previous node, 
and a pointer to the next node.

Functions:

   The d_list class Has three main functions. The first, 'd_list::append', is 
used to append characters to the end of the list. The second, 
'd_list::remove_last', is used to remove the last character from the list. The 
third, operator<<, is used to print all the characters in the d_list object.

The Main Program:

   The main program first creates a d_list object. It then promts the user to 
enter a string of characters. It uses the cin.get function to retrieve the 
characters from cin one at a time. If the character is a '#' remove_last is 
called otherwise append is called. once the newline character has been reached 
the d_list object is written to stdout.
