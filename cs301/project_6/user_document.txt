This program, postfixcalc, takes one argument from the command line (a file 
name) and reads the file evaluating each line as if it were a postfix 
arithmetic expression. Ex: the expression '7 5 +' would equal '12'.

The source for this program can be found on csci2 in the directory:

   /export/home/cs301/cs301145/projects/csci301_6/src

From within that directory enter the folowing commands:

Compile:

   g++ -c Pofxcalc.cpp -c Stack.cpp -c postfixcalc.cpp

Link:

   g++ Pofxcalc.o Stack.o postfixcalc.o -o postfixcalc

Execute:

   ./postfixcalc FILE
