   I decided to build a calculator object rather than build it into 
postfixcalc.cpp. I also decided to use the operator>> on the calculator object 
to input expressions. This should work for any kind of input stream. I would 
have liked to use a linked list for the stack and for my expr character array. 
This way there would be no limitations on the size of an equation. This could 
also be done for the token size. Another idea i thought would be nice was to 
make the creation of new operators in the Pofxcalc object dynamic. This would 
require building a 'handle' function that would take an operator string and a 
function of type 'bool (*)(Number, Number)'. operator-function pairs could be 
held in a struct and those in an array which could be iterated over in the 
evaluate function.
