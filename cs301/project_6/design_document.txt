Introduction:

   This program, postfixcalc, takes one argument from the command line (a file
name) and reads the file evaluating each line as if it were a postfix
arithmetic expression. For example the expression '7 5 +' would equal '12'. It
is capable of reading positive and negative integers up to 9 digits long and
can apply addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations on
them.

Data Structures:

   The main data structure being used is a sequential stack with a capacity of
100. It is used to hold the operands in the expression until they are used by
an operator. The Pofxcalc object also uses a character array with a capacity of
100 to store the expression as a string.

Functions:

   There are two primary functions being used in the Pofxcalc object.The first,
evaluate, Adds a token to the expression. If the token is an operator it
applies the operator to it's operands. If the token is an operand it is pushed
onto the stack. The second function, operator>>, reads one line from the stream
building tokens and calling evaluate on them.

The Main Program:

   The main program first creates a Pofxcalc object. It then handles the
command line arguments, opens the file, reads the contents into the Pofxcalc
object, and outputs the result.
