This program, getconc, will generate a concordance for the file entered on the
command line. It will work on any text file. Because this version of getconc
uses a binary search tree to store the words it is much more efficient. It can
be called on very large text files.

The source for this program can be found on csci2 in the directory:

/export/home/cs301/cs301145/projects/csci301_10/src

From within that directory enter the following commands:

Compile:

   g++ -c concordance.cpp -c getconc.cpp

Link:

   g++ concordance.o getconc.o -o getconc

Execute:

   ./getconc FILE
