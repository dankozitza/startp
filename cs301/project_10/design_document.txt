Introduction:

   This program, getconc, takes one command line argument (a file name) and 
outputs a concordance of it's contents. A concordance is a listing of all the
words that appear in the file along with the number of times each word appears.

Data Structures:

   The main data structure being used is a binary search tree implemented in
the concordance class. It's nodes consist of words and counts along with pointers
to it's child nodes. Other data structures used are character arrays used to hold
words.

Functions:

   The concordance class has four main functions. The insert function takes a 
word and adds it to the concordance. if the word already exists that node's 
count gets incremented. The get_count function takes a word and returns the 
count for that node. The length function returns the number of nodes in the 
list. The operator<< function is used to write the contents of the concordance
to a stream.

The Main Program:

   The main program first handles the command line, then opens the file given 
on the command line. Most of the work it does is parsing that file and placing 
words into the concordance object. After it has parsed the entire file it 
writes the concordance to stdout using the overloaded operator<< function. It 
also contains a small function for testing the unused concordance functions. 
This can be activated by entering 'Z' as the file name.
