   These three programs were built using recursive methods. They could all be 
written using iteration instead but in some cases recursion can produce a more 
elegant solution.

Question: What is the big-O of solve_hanoi?

   The big-O of solve_hanoi is 2^n-1.

Question: How would you modify prime_factorization to list the prime factors in 
decending order?

   By moving the line that outputs the denominator from above the recursive 
call to below the recursive call you reverse the order that the numbers are 
printed.
