Introduction:

   This program, solve_hanoi, describes to the user how to solve a particular 
game of hanoi. It takes as command line arguments the number of disks, the 
source peg, and the destination peg then using that information it creates a 
list of instructions for the user to move all the disks from the source peg to 
the destination peg.

Functions:

   The program uses one recursive function, hanoi, which takes three 
parameters: number of disks, source peg, and destination peg.

The Main Program:

   The main program parses the command line arguments then passes them to the 
hanoi function.
