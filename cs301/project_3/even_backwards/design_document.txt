Introduction:

   This program, even_backwards, takes one command line argument (a positive
integer) and outputs the even digits of that number backwards.

Functions:

   The program uses one recursive function, even_backwards, which does most of
the work for this program. It takes an output stream and a positive integer and
outputs the the even numbers backwards to the output stream.

The Main Program:

   The main program parses the command line argument then passes it to the
even_backwards function.
