   This program is a user interface to the Set object. It allows the user to 
modify a number of Set objects. Due to the way modsets.cpp is written there is 
little room for error when inputting commands. Before shipping this i would 
want to ensure the program won't crash due to user error. One thing i did 
different in the Set object is i only check that the size does not excede 
MAX_ITEMS in the insert function. Then i make sure that all the other member 
functions use the insert function rather than insert items manually. This means 
in some cases it will be checking the size more often than necessary. Say in 
the union function if i had it check the size once then add all the items 
manually it would be slightly more efficient than calling insert and checking 
the size every time.

Question: How might a function work that identifies the intersection
          of two Sets?

      I wrote this function as the -= operator. It loops through the right set
   removing each item in the right set from the left set.
