   It was interesting finding the characteristic operations of each of these. 
Working with all three of them gave me a much better idea of how they all work. 
The heap sort seems to be the most efficient assuming it's counting
characteristic operations correctly. The only time it is beaten is by insert
sort on an incrementing list.
