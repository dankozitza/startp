csci2>./qsim

You need to enter the variables used during the simulation.
These values can also be entered as command line arguments.
   ex: ./qsim QS_PAIRS CUST_PROB MAX_TRANS_TIME SIM_DURATION SEED

A customer will be represented as an 'id|wait_time' pair.
   ex: customer 12 who's been waiting 30 minutes would be
       represented as '12|30'.

Enter the number of queue/server pairs: 1
Enter the customer arrival probability (0 - 100): 0
Enter the maximum transaction time (minutes): 1
Enter the simulation duration time (minutes): 1
Enter a random integer: 777
