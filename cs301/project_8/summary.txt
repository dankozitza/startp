   I enjoyed messing round with this thing seeing what kind of behavior i could 
get. One thing i noticed is that the average wait time and longest wait time 
are only calculated for served customers. I wasn't sure whether this was the 
desired behavior or not so i left it. This program inspired me to write a 
seperate tool that times my program execution time. Originally i wrote it so 
that a customer had a wait_time variable that was incremented every loop. This 
meant looping through every customer sum_duration times. Because the print 
function already does this i didn't think it would matter but then i added the 
-q option and decided a pointer to the time variable would be better.
