   This program, qsim, is a queue simulator. A number of variables need to be 
entered to run the simulation. They can either be entered on the command line 
arguments or within the program at io prompts. There is one option, -q, which 
turns state output off. This greatly increases efficiency so that large 
simulations can be run.

The source for this program can be found on csci2 in the directory:

/export/home/cs301/cs301145/projects/csci301_8/src

From within that directory enter the following commands:

Compile:

   g++ -c qsim.cpp

Link:

   g++ qsim.o -o qsim

Execute:

   ./qsim

Examples:

   ./qsim 1 100 1 3 7

   ./qsim -q 3 100 5 5000 7
