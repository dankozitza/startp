Introduction:

   My program, modsets, is a user interface that allows the user to modify
a number of Set objects in various ways. The Set object is an unordered list
of unique items. Meaning individual items may only appear in the set once.

Data Structures:

   The program uses an array of Sets in modsets.cpp and an array of Items in
Set.hpp. The array in modsets.cpp is used to hold a number of Set objects that
the user can modify by identifying them by their index in the array. The
array in Set.hpp is only accessed/modified by the Set object's member
functions. It is used to Hold all of the Items in the Set.

Functions:

   There are two functions in modsets.cpp: one to print a list of the populated
Sets and one to print the result of the Set::found function. There are twelve
functions in Set.hpp: two constructors, a function to re-initialize the set, a
function to get the size of the set, a function to search for an item, functions
to insert and remove items, two union operators, two intersect operators, and a
friend function overloading the '<<' operator.

The Main Program:

   The main program is a user interactive loop that prompts the user for
commands. Each command allows the user to interact with the Sets.
