This program 'modsets' is a user interface that allows the user to modify Set
objects. After it is run it will prompt the user to enter a command. Each
command is a single letter possibly followed by arguments. The n arguments
identify the set you wish to run the command on. The v arguments represent
an item.

The following are commands to be used for building the executable 'modsets'.

Compile:

   g++ -c Set.cpp -c modsets.cpp

Link:

   g++ Set.o modsets.o -o modsets

Execute:

   ./modsets
