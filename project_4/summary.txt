	This program can read from any text file and generate a concordance 
consisting of words with a maximum length of 8 characters. I decided to leave 
all the file parsing code in the main rather than have a seperate function
for it. It would probably be easier to read if there was a seperate function. 
Another thing i would like to do would be to keep a size member and 
increment/decrement it when necessary to avoid all the work in the 
concordance::length function. I ended up messing around and writing
recursive equals and less_than functions before i read the hints.
